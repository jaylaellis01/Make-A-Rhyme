## Instructions to add a new poem
Firstly, you need to add the poem image into the assets/poem_art folder, and add all the poem audio into the assets/audio/{poem_name} folder. The audio should be named sequentially (1.mp3, 2.mp3, and so on)

Next, you need to input all the poem information. All poem data is located in the src/poem/poem_data.json file. Taking a look at this file, you can set up a new poem similar to how the others are set up. Each poem is required to have:

- name: Name of poem
- image: Image location
- img_w: width of image
- img_h: height of image
- words: array of data for each word
    - x and y coordinates from the top left (as a proportion) for the location of the box/image on the background image
        - x,y between 0 and 1 (in order to scale properly)
        - (0,0) is the top left corner, (1,1) is the bottom right corner
        - Find pixel numbers for x,y on original image, then divide by image width and height respectively
    - categories: array of potential category numbers for that box (e.g [4,5,6] if the box could be an animal, a water animal, or a bird)
    - spot-id: ID of the box corresponding to the picture codes document (A, B, C, etc.)
- text: array of poem lines - each index of the array should correspond to an audio file
- cueBox: ID of the box that is cued after a certain poem line is read (e.g. after the index 0 line in Pet Party Picnic ("Once on a pretend time didnâ€™t you tell me how") is read, index 0 in cueBox (box A) is cued for the child to select it)

After adding all of this poem data, all you need to do is add another div block in the landing.html file, similar to the div blocks that are there for the other poems.

## Instructions to add a new word
- Add the word to the /src/global/words.csv file on the line matching its category
- Add the word artwork in (word).png format to /assets/word_assets/word_art/(cateogry)
    - e.g. for 'Ant' category = 1 add Ant.png to /assets/word_assets/word_art/1
- Add the word audio file in (word).mp3 format to /assets/word_assets/word_audio
    - e.g. for 'Ant' add Ant.mp3 to /assets/word_assets/word_audio
